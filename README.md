 The Final Project of the Microsoft and Kodluyoruz Collaboration in Back-end Development: Minesweeper Game




 The Minesweeper Game developed as the final project of this program serves as a significant milestone where participants apply their acquired back-end technologies and work on a real project. The Minesweeper Game, developed using Java (or the preferred programming language), stands out with its user-friendly interface and impressive gaming mechanics.

Project Description:

The Minesweeper Game is based on the logic of revealing a selected cell and updating the game board until all mines are uncovered. The user selects any point on the game board, and if there is a mine at the chosen location, the user loses the game. If there is no mine, numbers indicating the number of mines around that point are displayed. The objective is for the user to discover all mine-free areas to complete the game.
